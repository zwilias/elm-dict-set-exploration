{-| A dictionary mapping unique keys to values. The keys can be any comparable
type. This includes `Int`, `Float`, `Time`, `Char`, `String`, and tuples or
lists of comparable types.

Insert, remove, and query operations all take *O(log n)* time.

{-| A dictionary of keys and values. So a `(Dict String User)` is a dictionary
that lets you look up a `String` (such as user names) and find the associated
`User`.

{-| Create an empty dictionary.
-}

empty =

{-| Get the value associated with a key. If the key is not found, return
`Nothing`. This is useful when you are not sure if a key will be in the
dictionary.

    get "Tom"   animals == Just Cat
    get "Jerry" animals == Just Mouse
    get "Spike" animals == Nothing

a collision.
-}

no changes are made.

-- COMBINE


{-| Combine two dictionaries. If there is a collision, preference is given
to the first dictionary.

{-| Keep a key-value pair when its key appears in the second dictionary.
Preference is given to values in the first dictionary.

-}
diff : Dict comparable v -> Dict comparable v -> Dict comparable v
diff t1 t2 =
    filter (\k v -> not <| member k t2) t1


{-| The most general way of combining two dictionaries. You provide three
accumulators for when a given key appears:

    1. Only in the left dictionary.
    2. In both dictionaries.
    3. Only in the right dictionary.

You then traverse all the keys from lowest to highest, building up whatever
you want.
